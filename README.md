# Interactive Map for Red Dead Redemption 2

This project is a free and simple alternative to paid interactive maps found online.

It does not require any account creation, nor internet connection* after loading the page. All data are stored in your localStorage.

This project is kept simple intentionnally and I'm not planning on updating it.

## Use the map [here](https://controleur.github.io/rdr2/) or download the [release](https://github.com/controleur/rdr2/archive/refs/tags/V1.0.0.zip) !

## Tools used

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for the map system.
- [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) with a custom script to create the 16â€¯828 tiles.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make the overall smoother.


*Dependencies are served via CDN. If you want to use the map locally, you will have to download the resources by hand or load the page with an internet connection. This includes bootstrap, leaflet and the font.
